# Cattle RAG Flask

This repository provides a minimal starting point for building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application with a Flask web interface. All code files and templates are currently empty placeholders that can be extended to suit your own project.

## Features

- Basic Flask project layout with folders for templates, static assets, and utility modules.
- Directories for storing embeddings, FAISS indexes, and other data required for a RAG pipeline.
- HTML template stubs for login, knowledge management, and querying an LLM.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd cattle-rag-flask
   ```
2. **Create a Python environment**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**
   
   Add any required packages to `requirements.txt` and run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Run the application**
   
   `app.py` is intended to be the Flask entrypoint. After filling in the code, you can start the server with:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Directory Layout

```
├── app.py           # Flask entrypoint (empty)
├── auth.py          # Authentication logic
├── config.py        # Configuration settings
├── data/            # Example data files (placeholders)
├── embeddings/      # Embedding utilities
├── static/          # Static files (JS, CSS, images)
├── templates/       # HTML templates
├── vector_db/       # Vector database helpers
```

All files are currently empty; you can use this structure as a foundation for your own RAG implementation.
