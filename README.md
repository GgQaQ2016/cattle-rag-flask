# Cattle RAG Flask

This project provides a minimal demonstration of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) web application using Flask.  The repository contains blueprints for authentication, knowledge management and a very small example RAG endpoint.  It is intentionally lightweight so it can run in limited environments.

To start the application locally:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

The database uses SQLite by default and will be created automatically on first run.
